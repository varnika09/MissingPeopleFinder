Abstract
Face recognition is becoming increasingly significant in a variety of sectors and regions, and it is advancing technology. Face recognition is utilised in this project  to solve a real-world problem: finding lost people. 
The programme has some new features, such as a location feature, an upload option, and a few more.


Project Description
The facial recognition library of Python is used in this project to determine whether or not a person is missing by examining the data provided in the application. 
Furthermore, if the user uses the programme to determine if the individual is a missing person or not, the user's current location will be revealed which will help the police to detect the exact location of the missing person if contacted. The application also allows you to upload a missing person's image file, which will be saved in the dataset folder.
